#Introduction

Phenotype of Parkinson is complex and multifactorial. Main manifestiation is death of preferential dopaminergic neurons in Substantia Nigra (SN) and the production of intracytoplasmic inclusions of proteion/lipid called Lewy Bodies (LB).

Motor symptoms
 * Bradykinesia
 * Rigidity
 * Tremor
 * Postural instability

Non-motor symptoms 
 * Hyposomia
 * autonomic dysfunction
 * REM sleep behaviour disorders
 * depression
 * Cognitive decline

2 Main questions:
1. Why is PD so prevalent and harmful in SN? (As it is also affecting elsewhere)
2. What is the actual mechanism of this neurodegeneration?
