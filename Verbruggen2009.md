#Verbruggen and Logan (2009) - Proactive adjustments ofresponse strategies in the stop-signal paradigm

#Intro
Goals of go- and stop-task have opposing requirements.
5 experiments that manipulate occurence of stop-trials, lookin at the effects on go-task.

_Reactive_ response strategy adjustment has been found: after unsuccesful inhibits subjects are more careful.

In stop signal task, subjects are told not to wait for stop-signal, however RTs _are_ longer when stop-probability increases. RTs are also longer when stop-signal is expected versus not-expected.

These longer RTs can be intereted in two ways:
1. Response strategy adjustment (_proactive adjustment hypothesis_)
2. Increased cognitive demands (_dual task requirement hypothesis_)

These hypothesis make different predictions about parameters in DDM that are influenced:

Proactive adjustment hypothesis: threshold
Dual task requirement hypothesis: drift rate, non-decision time

##Present study
5 Experiments

###Experiment 1
Ignore stop-signal versus don't ignore stop-signal.

N= 18, 33% stop trials.

Trials after incorrect trials or stop-trials were excluded. A

####Result
In stop-blocks, t0 is higher, v is lower and a is higher. 

###Experiment 2
No stopping, but a second go-task on 'relevant signal trials' (dual-task).
Go task 2: press space bar.

####Result
No significant difference in a, higher v for dual-task condition (unexpected!), longer t for dual-task.

###Experiment 3
Same as experiment 1, but the lenght of the blocks is manipulated (1, 2 and 4).

####Results
