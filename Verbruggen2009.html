<h1>Verbruggen and Logan (2009) - Proactive adjustments ofresponse strategies in the stop-signal paradigm</h1>

<h1>Intro</h1>

<p>Goals of go- and stop-task have opposing requirements.
5 experiments that manipulate occurence of stop-trials, lookin at the effects on go-task.</p>

<p><em>Reactive</em> response strategy adjustment has been found: after unsuccesful inhibits subjects are more careful.</p>

<p>In stop signal task, subjects are told not to wait for stop-signal, however RTs <em>are</em> longer when stop-probability increases. RTs are also longer when stop-signal is expected versus not-expected.</p>

<p>These longer RTs can be intereted in two ways:
1. Response strategy adjustment (<em>proactive adjustment hypothesis</em>)
2. Increased cognitive demands (<em>dual task requirement hypothesis</em>)</p>

<p>These hypothesis make different predictions about parameters in DDM that are influenced:</p>

<p>Proactive adjustment hypothesis: threshold
Dual task requirement hypothesis: drift rate, non-decision time</p>

<h2>Present study</h2>

<p>5 Experiments</p>

<h3>Experiment 1</h3>

<p>Ignore stop-signal versus don&rsquo;t ignore stop-signal.</p>

<p>N= 18, 33% stop trials.</p>

<p>Trials after incorrect trials or stop-trials were excluded. A</p>

<h4>Result</h4>

<p>In stop-blocks, t0 is higher, v is lower and a is higher.</p>

<h3>Experiment 2</h3>

<p>No stopping, but a second go-task on &lsquo;relevant signal trials&rsquo; (dual-task).
Go task 2: press space bar.</p>

<h4>Result</h4>

<p>No significant difference in a, higher v for dual-task condition (unexpected!), longer t for dual-task.</p>

<h3>Experiment 3</h3>

<p>Same as experiment 1, but the lenght of the blocks is manipulated (1, 2 and 4).</p>

<h4>Results</h4>

<p>Similar effects as experiment 1.</p>

<h3>Experiment 4</h3>

<p>Selective stopping, three conditions: 1) always stop, 2) only stop when low tone, 3) only stop when high tone.</p>

<h4>Results</h4>

<p>Higher tresholds in stopping conditions, longer t0 in stopping conditions, no difference in drift. There were no significant differences between condition 2 and 3 versus condition 1 in the go-process. SSRTs were higher for 2 and 3 versus 1 (this was a replication of Riegler (1986)).</p>

<h3>Experiment 5</h3>

<p>Proportion of stop signals is manipulated (0%, 30% and 70%).</p>

<h4>Results</h4>

<p>Greater boundary separation with more stop strials. Non-significant increase of t0. Decrease of drift rate in with higher prob. of stop-trials. 70% trials are not really analyzed because too little trials.</p>

<h2>General Discussion</h2>

<p>The experiment found support for both hypoteses (response caution adjustment versus dual-task effect). The dual-task effects seem bigger in a setting where a secodn action is required (experiment 2) versus a stop-requirement (experiment 3). This dual-task effect can mostly be explained by the t0-parameter. The effects on drift rate were paradoxical.</p>

<h3>proactive response strategy adjustment</h3>

<p>The authors make a connection to the SAT: dual-task requierements would be similar.</p>

<p>The authors claim subjects can make trial-to-trial adjustments in their response strategies, even without explicit instruction to do so.</p>

<h3>Dutal-task costs</h3>

<p>Multiple studies have shown that SSRT is barely influenced by go-processing. Go-task can still be influenced by presence of stop-task. RTs are still increased in these studies!</p>

<h3>Delayed-responding hypothesis</h3>

<p>The authors note that the difference in non-decision time were smaller in the dual-task setting (experiment 2) versus the other settings. They consider alternative explanations.
The <em>delayed responding hypothesis</em> assumes subjects postpone processing of the go stimulus, the execution of the go response, or both, until they know they can safely execute the response.
The authors deem this hypothesis implausible because:
1. SSD changes after every trial, making it difficult to estimate
2. Subjects need to estimate SSRT, also hard.
3. Time estimation is an effortful process, would make it even more difficult.</p>

<h3>Response supression hypothesis</h3>

<p>The <em>respons-supression hypothesis</em> assumes that the opposing task goals supress motor output and this effect is particularly stong in the stop-signal paradigm. Frank (2006) is mentioned: STN activation could achieve such suppression. This suppression would occur as t0 in the fits. It does not exclude that subjects would <em>also</em> modulate thresholds. Rinkenauer et al. (2004) showed that SAT also influences non-decisional processes.</p>

<p>The authors mention that the found drift-rate effects are problematic and &ldquo;To our knowledge, strategic effects on growth rate have not been studies systematically so further research is needed&rdquo;.</p>

<h2>Practical Guidelines</h2>

<p>The authors mention that subjects slow down their responses during stop-tasks, even when they are instructed not to do so. Therefore &ldquo;it is advisable to keep the proportion of stop signals as low as possible&rdquo;.</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<ul>
<li>Subjects can adjust response strategies proactively</li>
<li>Longer RT <em>and</em> higher accuracy when pre-cues indicate stop-trials

<ul>
<li>Probably response-strategy adjustments</li>
<li>&ldquo;Dual task requirements played a smaller role&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Model f its show that these response strategies involve increase the response threshold, and &ldquo;possibly&rdquo;, supressing the motor output.</li>
</ul>
